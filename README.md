# Buchberger's Algorithm
This C\# code provides a complete implementation of **Buchberger's algorithm**, a fundamental tool in computational algebraic geometry used to compute a **Gröbner basis** for an ideal in a polynomial ring. A Gröbner basis is a special set of polynomials that has useful properties, such as providing a standardized way to solve systems of polynomial equations.</br>
</br>
Pure C#, no binaries. No dependencies except for Microsoft's unit testing.
