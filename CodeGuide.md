This C\# code provides a complete implementation of **Buchberger's algorithm**, a fundamental tool in computational algebraic geometry used to compute a **Gröbner basis** for an ideal in a polynomial ring. A Gröbner basis is a special set of polynomials that has useful properties, such as providing a standardized way to solve systems of polynomial equations.

The code has classes representing mathematical concepts like monomials, terms, and polynomials, along with the core algorithm itself. Let's dive into what each part of the code does and how you can use it.

-----

## Core Data Structures

The foundation of the project is built upon three main data structures that represent the components of polynomials: `Monomial`, `Term`, and `Polynomial`.

### **`Monomial.cs`**

This class represents a monomial, which is a product of variables raised to non-negative integer powers (e.g., $x^2y^3$ ).

  * **What it does:** It stores the exponents of variables in a `ImmutableSortedDictionary<string, int>`, where the `string` is the variable name and the `int` is its exponent. It includes methods for basic monomial arithmetic, such as multiplication, division, and finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two monomials.
  * **Key Features:**
      * `Multiply(Monomial other)`: Multiplies two monomials.
      * `Divide(Monomial other)`: Divides one monomial by another, returning `null` if not divisible.
      * `Lcm(Monomial m1, Monomial m2)`: Computes the least common multiple of two monomials.
      * `IComparable<Monomial>` and `IEquatable<Monomial>`: Allows for comparing and checking the equality of monomials.

### **`Term.cs`**

This class represents a term, which is a coefficient multiplied by a monomial (e.g., $5x^2y^3$).

  * **What it does:** It combines a `double` coefficient and a `Monomial` object. It provides methods for multiplying terms and converting them to a readable string format.
  * **Key Features:**
      * `Multiply(double scalar)`: Multiplies a term by a scalar value.
      * `Multiply(Monomial otherMonomial)`: Multiplies a term by a monomial.
      * `ToString()` and `ToMagnitudeString()`: Provides string representations of the term, with and without the sign of the coefficient.

### **`Polynomial.cs`**

This class represents a polynomial, which is a sum of terms.

  * **What it does:** It stores a list of `Term` objects. The constructor automatically normalizes the terms by combining like terms and removing terms with a zero coefficient. It also includes methods for polynomial arithmetic (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) and for identifying the leading term, monomial, and coefficient.
  * **Key Features:**
      * `Add(Polynomial other)`, `Subtract(Polynomial other)`, `Multiply(Term term)`: Perform basic polynomial arithmetic.
      * `GetLeadingTerm(IMonomialComparer comparer)`: Finds the leading term of the polynomial based on a specified monomial ordering.
      * `IsZero`: A property to check if the polynomial is the zero polynomial.
      * `IEquatable<Polynomial>`: Allows for checking the equality of polynomials.

## Monomial Ordering

A crucial concept in Buchberger's algorithm is the **monomial ordering**, which defines how to compare monomials. This implementation provides an interface and a concrete implementation for this.

### **`IMonomialComparer.cs`**

This interface defines the contract for any class that compares monomials. It inherits from `IComparer<Monomial>` and adds a property to specify the order of variables.

  * **What it does:** It ensures that any monomial ordering provides a `Compare` method and a list of ordered variables.

### **`LexicographicComparer.cs`**

This class provides a specific implementation of `IMonomialComparer` for the **lexicographic order**. In this ordering, monomials are compared variable by variable, like words in a dictionary.

  * **What it does:** It compares two monomials based on the exponents of the variables in a predefined order. For example, with variables ordered `x > y`, the monomial $x^2y$ would be greater than $xy^2$ because the exponent of `x` is higher in the first monomial.

## Core Algorithm

The heart of the project lies in the `BuchbergerAlgorithm` and `PolynomialOperations` classes.

### **`PolynomialOperations.cs`**

This static class provides helper methods for key operations in Buchberger's algorithm.

  * **What it does:**
      * `CalculateSPolynomial(Polynomial f, Polynomial g, IMonomialComparer comparer)`: Computes the **S-polynomial** of two polynomials, which is a specific combination designed to cancel their leading terms.
      * `Reduce(Polynomial f, ImmutableList<Polynomial> G, IMonomialComparer comparer)`: Performs multivariate polynomial division, reducing a polynomial `f` by a set of polynomials `G` until it can no longer be reduced.
      * `MakeMonic(Polynomial p, IMonomialComparer comparer)`: Makes a polynomial monic by dividing it by its leading coefficient, so the leading coefficient becomes 1.

### **`BuchbergerAlgorithm.cs`**

This is the main class that implements Buchberger's algorithm.

  * **What it does:** The `ComputeGroebnerBasis` method takes an initial list of polynomials (a basis for an ideal) and returns a reduced Gröbner basis for that ideal.
  * **How it works:**
    1.  It starts with the initial basis and a queue of all pairs of polynomials from that basis.
    2.  It repeatedly takes a pair of polynomials from the queue, calculates their S-polynomial, and reduces it by the current basis.
    3.  If the reduced S-polynomial is not zero, it is added to the basis, and new pairs are formed with the new polynomial.
    4.  This process continues until all pairs have been considered and all S-polynomials reduce to zero.
    5.  After the main loop, the `ReduceAndNormalizeGroebnerBasis` method is called to simplify the resulting basis into a **reduced Gröbner basis**, which is a unique and more computationally efficient representation.

## How to Use the Code

The `Program.cs` file provides a clear example of how to use the `BuchbergerAlgorithm` library. Here's a step-by-step guide to running it:

### **1. Set Up the Project**

The project is a standard .NET 9.0 console application. You can build and run it using the .NET CLI or an IDE like Visual Studio.

### **2. Define Variables and Monomial Order**

First, you need to define the variables you'll be working with and choose a monomial ordering. In the example, the variables are "x" and "y", and the ordering is lexicographic with `x > y`.

```csharp
ImmutableList<string> orderedVariables = ImmutableList.Create("x", "y");
IMonomialComparer lexComparer = new LexicographicComparer(orderedVariables);
```

### **3. Create Polynomials**

Next, you need to create the polynomials that form your initial basis. You do this by creating `Term` objects, which are made up of `Monomial` objects and coefficients.

```csharp
// f1 = x^2y - 1
ImmutableSortedDictionary<string, int> exponents_f1_t1 = ImmutableSortedDictionary.CreateRange(new Dictionary<string, int> { { "x", 2 }, { "y", 1 } });
Monomial mono_f1_t1 = new Monomial(exponents_f1_t1);
Term term_f1_t1 = new Term(1.0, mono_f1_t1);
Term term_f1_t2 = new Term(-1.0, Monomial.One);
Polynomial f1 = new Polynomial(new Term[] { term_f1_t1, term_f1_t2 });
```

### **4. Compute the Gröbner Basis**

With your initial basis and monomial comparer ready, you can call the `ComputeGroebnerBasis` method.

```csharp
List<Polynomial> initialBasis = new List<Polynomial> { f1, f2 };
ImmutableList<Polynomial> groebnerBasis = BuchbergerAlgorithm.ComputeGroebnerBasis(initialBasis, lexComparer);
```

### **5. View the Results**

Finally, you can print the resulting Gröbner basis to the console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nComputed Gröbner Basis G:");
foreach (Polynomial p in groebnerBasis)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"- {p}");
}
```

When you run the example in `Program.cs`, it will compute the Gröbner basis for the ideal generated by the polynomials $f\_1 = x^2y - 1$ and $f\_2 = xy^2 - x$, and you will see the initial basis and the final computed Gröbner basis printed to the console.
